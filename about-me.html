      <p> This is my bestfriend <strong>Narem</strong>! I adopted her out of our trash when she was just a tiny kitten. She and her sibling were just your run of the mill trailer litter and after we had our first terible snow in Minot I decided the next time I heard them digging in our trash I was going to try and scoop them up and Narem has lived with me ever since :)</p>

      <p>So when it comes to hobbies i've always had a pretty unstable relationship between the outdoors and doing "fit" things and being indoors and heavy gaming. My current favorite games are League of Legends, TFT, JackBox on weekends and just kind of rummaging around though whatever indie game is fresh. I try to stay busy hiking and lifting weights.    </p>
