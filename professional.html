    <p style="color:grey"> Spent four years pursuing a Graphic Design BA at MSU because of my interest in game design and art. After I left Minot I became a food service worker with a variety of Mom and Pop Shops. Shorty their after I discovered The Exchange and I spent 5 year climbing the ranks and becoming a Facility Manager. I spent the next 8 years as a Facility Manager picking up as many new breaths of experience and certificates as I could with the intention of moving to being Food Court Manger, also taking a semesters course work in Business Management with PPCC. I became interested in making a career change and pursuing something more natured to towards my interests in technology and computers. After deliberating and careful consideration with a wide variety of friends and colleagues in IT fields I decided to make the move to join a boot-camp for coding and enrolled in Epicodus in July of 2022. I am hopeful to find myself in a field more driven towards my passions and believe that after I have finished my Epicodus education I will be able to pursue a career in programming and likely move myself back to the West Coast.</p>
